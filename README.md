# MoviesWebSite

The aim of this project is to learn in a deep way how javascript works.

### Description
1. At this Project you can search a movie by title and the System will present you the movies which fits better to your search text with their information
2. You can rate the presented movies with 0 or 0.5 .... or 5
3. You can ask the system to recomend movies(The app achieves this by searching users' data and finds out which user is closer to you)
